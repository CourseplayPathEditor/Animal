Here we define and explain the lua files created.
--------------------------------------------------
-- ToDo: recreate this page.
files:
main.lua: i go change this name to setup instead of main
- this file is used to setup the main structure and handle the loading and saving
this will be the second script that needs to be loaded to set the global structure.
i create this file first to c if all is working before i start on the manager.lua

manager.lua:
- this will be the first script that needs to be loaded.
i was thinking to set it up like courseplay is done
load all scripts from this file and seperate main functions in classes and expanded lua
one lua that handles the breeding, one for controling changes and so on

breed.lua:
- this script controlles the breeding
all it need to do is check, modify or update the breedpool
when a animal starts breeding a reference of that animal need to be insert in the breedpool
also a counter need to be added for stats

development only
----------------
conf.lua:
- here i go copy the create config code from main.lua.
-----------------------------------------------------
workflow of the scripts:
------------------------
moddesc.xml, will load manager.lua as main script.
manager.lua, will load main.lua to setup the main structure, breed.lua, all not created lua
-----------------------------------------------------
info
-----
i go look where i go load the config file from.
also i go try to use animalType in my functions, that i did not do in my 2013 version, 
result a very long coding that could be a lot shorter by using [animalType].
