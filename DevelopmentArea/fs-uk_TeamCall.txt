i'm jengske and i have bin working for many years on a animalMod. i have a non-published version for fs2013.
this was done with the help of Decker and Xentro who guided me in scripting.

At that point my knowledge of scripting was poor, last year i took some courses mainly on c# for Unity 3D.
By doing the courses i get a better understanding. And see now where i could adjust or write shorter code as i did on the fs2013 version.

Therefore we going to create a complete new version. The idea of the original 'AnimalMod' stays the same but the way we go handle it will be complete new.

For this we need people that could do the following:
- create 3dmodels and know how to create the xml files for it
- animate the models, directly inside 3dsmax/maya or true xml 
- mapdesign, you need to have advanced knowledge
- scripting, have a good knowledge of  lua and the workflow of the game

If you have one of the skills mentioned in the list above and you're interested in the project and want to be part of the team.
You can leave a reply with your contact information and provide us examples of work you done.

The team will evaluate and let you know if your accepted. Once in the team we will provide you with the needed information.

Plz do not reply if you do not have the skills needed for our project, we looking for serious people that have the proper knowledge. 

thx
AnimalMod Team
